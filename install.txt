REQUIREMENTS

SEO Scripts has the following server requirements. These are all fairly standard on a modern webserver.

    * MySQL
    * Apache w/ mod_rewrite, CURL, and GD support

Basic knowledge of FTP and an FTP client will be needed to upload the software to your server.

Note: There is no upgrade option for SEO Scripts 2.0 from 1.x sites. It is a full rewrite.


INSTALLATION

See the latest instructions online:

Once you have successfully purchased SEO Scripts, you will receive an email containing download 
instructions. Follow those instructions to download the latest version of SEO Scripts to your
computer in .ZIP format. Unzip the file on your desktop or somewhere easy to remember. You should 
now have a folder named slseopro-2.0, containing another folder called "upload".

Using your favorite FTP client, upload the contents of the "upload" folder to your Web server. Make sure 
you upload all files to the folder you want the site to run on. Usually this will be `public_html` 
or `htdocs`, but you can also upload the files to a subfolder or subdomain on your site.

Once all of your files have been uploaded, you must run the install script to complete installation. 
Load up your favorite browser and head to:

http://www.yourdomain.com/install/

Make sure you replace `www.yourdomain.com` with the URL where you have uploaded SEO Scripts.

The installer will guide you through the rest of the process. Make sure you delete the 
`install` folder when complete.
