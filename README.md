# slseoscripts

This project is abandonware.

This is the last major release of Scriptalicious SEO Scripts Pro, a suite of SEO tools built on the Kytoo framework.

Kytoo is a custom PHP framework I wrote over several years (2007-2009ish). It encompasses around 25k lines of PHP.
Exceptions are use of the Inutio XML-RPC Library and probably a few lines of code from Stack.

Kytoo powered several commercial, web-based apps that I built around that time, including Scriptalcious, phpLinkBid,
and PageHeat.

Don't expect any of the SEO tools to work anymore. This was back when PageRank was all the craze, and it took regular
work to keep the parsers parsing.

## Features

Under the hood of SEO Scripts Pro is a dusty old application framework:

- Templating engine (no, it isn't Smarty)
- ORM
- Session Manager
- Authentication
- Validation
- Permissions
- Form Rendering
- Application Base
- Config Manager
- Menu Builder
- Navigation Manager
- Utilities (heaps of them)
- Loads of other stuff...

Aside from framework components, Kytoo is also a CMS and an application framework, meaning it has support for public and private
admin interfaces with permissions & auth, CMS/page builder, and modular system for building administration panels.

## Warnings

The code here is provided with no warranty or license. It's only made available for entertainment and educational purposes.

The code here is often ugly and barbaric.

The code here worked, and it worked damn well for many, many years without a single recorded vulnerability. So, you know,
think what you will. ;-)

Kytoo powered over 100K websites, but it isn't powering anything these days. It was last seen watching PHP 5 walk in the door.

Feel free to use this code for entertainment or in your own projects, but its utility has been largely replaced with
much more modern, powerful frameworks like Laravel, etc.
